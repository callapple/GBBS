get  the  [ Download Menu  Bar ].  Look
below on the options to download.

       able for Download.

       able via this command.  It might

[ A)scii, D)os Xmodem, P)roDOS Xmodem ]
[ S)tandard Xmodem (ibm,trs), Q)uit ? ]

[ A ]  [A]scii  download  will  convert
       the program to Ascii  characters
(characters with the values of  0-127).
Text  files  are sent  as  text;  Basic
programs are sent in a line format in a
compacted  form with Print converted to
a "?";  Binary programs are sent in the
typical "Address : Data .. .. .." form.
You will need to use a terminal program
with a Capture buffer such as "Mod Term
7".  After  you save it,  capture it to
disk and after you hang up,  "EXEC" the
file.

[ D ]  [D]os Xmodem  is the choice  you
       would  pick  if  you  are  using
"Ascii Express Pro" Dos 3.3 version.

[ P ]  [P]roDOS  Xmodem is  the  choice
       you  would pick if you are using
"Ascii Express Pro" ProDOS version.

[ S ]  [S]tandard Xmodem will  download
       the  file in the standard Xmodem
format without all of the special  file
headers  that AE uses for Apple  files.
Computers such as IBMs, TRSs and others
would choose this option if you have  a
terminal program that has the capabili-
ties to use Xmodem transfer.  Otherwise
you must use Ascii Download.

After  you choose how the file will  be
downloaded,  you will be given the mes-
sage: [ Sending filename,  ## blocks ],
which will confirm the name of the file
and the approximate number of  128-byte
blocks being transferred.   When PRO is
ready  to  download  you will  get  the
message:  [ Press <CR> to begin ].  Af-
ter you hit [RETURN],  indicate to your
software  you are ready to receive  the
file.

[ Q ]  [Q]uit  will  abort  from   this
       section.

[ A ]  [A]scii upload will  accept  the
       program  in  the form  of  Ascii
characters  (characters with the values
of  0-127).   Basic  and  binary  files
should  be changed to text files before
they are uploaded.

[ D ]  [D]os Xmodem  is the choice  you
       would  pick  if  you  are  using
"Ascii Express Pro" Dos 3.3 version.

[ P ]  [P]roDOS  Xmodem is  the  choice
       you  would pick if you are using

[ S ]  [S]tandard  Xmodem  will  upload
       text   files  in  the   standard
Xmodem  format without all of the  spe-
cial file headers that AE uses.

After  you  make  your  choice  on  the
method of uploading, you will be asked:
[ Filename: ] and can enter the name of
the file you are uploading.   When  you
get  the message [ Press <CR> to  begin
].  If  you are using a form of  Xmodem
transfer,  begin the transfer.  If  you
are  using  the "A)scii" mode you  will
begin  the transfer after  you  receive
the message:

Upload file now. Enter a ctrl-D, ctrl-D
when finished or ESC, ESC to abort.
