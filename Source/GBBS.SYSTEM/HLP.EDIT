To  delete the  last        line entered use .DL.[ .E ]  If you enter a number after the        .E command,  that corresponding        line of text will be edited. To        edit the last line type .EL.[ .H ]  This  will  print out  the  Dot        command help file on the screen        and  let you continue to  write        your message.[ .I ]  The .I command must be followed        by a number.
