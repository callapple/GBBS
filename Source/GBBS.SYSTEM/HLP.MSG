After you enter[A] you are asked:  [ Is this a privateletter? ].  If you answer [Y] then  theperson receives the letter in his mail-box.  If you  answer [N] then you  willpost a message on the board as a  replyto the original message for everyone toread.  You will use the editor to enterthe message  and when you are finished,you will return to the Menu Bar.[ N ]  [N]ext or a [RETURN] will go  to       the next  bulletin on the board.[ R ]  [R]e-read allows you to read the       present bulletin again.[ Q ]  [Q]uit will stop retrieving bul-       letins  and  exit  back  to  theOption Menu Bar.[ + ]  This  command must be used after       the  [F]orward  command  at  theMenu  Bar  prompt.
