To Build GBBS Pro v2.2 in Merlin 8/16 on a GS running GSOS:

Before you start, setup your source code in a directory on your GS similar to:

	Work/GBBS/Config
		 /ACOS
		 /GBBS.CONFIG
		 /GBBS.SYSTEM

Copy the "Config" sources to the config folder, the "ACOS" sources to the ACOS folder, and the files from the GBBS Config floppy to the GBBS.CONFIG folder, and the files from the GBBS system floppy to the GBBS.SYSTEM folder.

Config and ACOS are where you will be editing, assembling and linking source code. Once you are ready to test a build, copy the resulting files from /Config to /GBBS.CONFIG and the resulting files from /ACOS to /GBBS.SYSTEM. Then copy the contents of the /GBBS folders to floppy disks images (.DSK or .PO) for testing in a virtual machine. Those images can later be written to actual floppy disks (eg, via Applesauce) for use on real hardware.


Build Steps:

1. You may need to edit your Merlin 8/16 PARMS file to match on the following defines:

	BUB		DFB	%01100110

	LSTDODFT	DFB	%01001001

Then assemble the file to create a new PARMS file.

2. Use the NEWPARMS command to load the new PARMS file:

	NEWPARMS

3. Set prefix 2 to your GBBS pro folder:

	PFX 2=/DRIVE/GBBS.SOURCE

At this time it is suggested you create a project with the PROJECT command.

	PROJECT SAVE GBBS

NOTE: if you save a GBBS project, be sure to do the NEWPARMS command before saving, as the params are part of the project! This is great, because then you can restore the default params settings and only have the GBBS params applied when working on the GBBS project.

4. Change your prefix to the CONFIG folder:

	PFX 2/CONFIG

5. Load and assemble all the files in these folders (yes, 1 at a time):

(NOTE: you will want to use the PFX command to change the current directory to the base for each of these sub-folders, like PFX 2/CONFIG/CLOCKS)

Clocks/
	Iic
	Iigs
	Mountain
	No.Slot
	Null
	Prodos
	Serialpro
	Thunder
	Ultra
	Versa

Modems/
	Cat103
	Cat212
	Gsport		(TWICE, first for slot 1, second for slot 2) GS Only driver
	Gsport.Hst	(TWICE, first for slot 1, second for slot 2) GS Only driver
	HAYES.NEW	(TWICE, first for slot 1, second for slot 2) GS Only driver
	HAYES.SSC	(super serial card)
	Mm2
	Multispd
	Nocar
	Nullmdm
	Singlespd

Printers/
	Null
	Parallel
	Serial
	Grappler

Video/
	Vid40
	Vid40pl
	Vid80
	Videx

6. Set the prefix back to the config folder

	PFX 2/CONFIG

7. load and assemble:

Config/
	Config
	Initstr

8. In the editor type Command-O to get the "Command:" prompt box

9. Type "link make" and press return

The resulting file is:

	config.system

10. Switch to the Acos folder

	PFX 2/ACOS

11. Load and assemble

Acos/
	ACOS
	ACOS.LOAD

Resulting files are:

	ACOS.OBJ
	ENCODE
	ACOS.SYSTEM

12. Now, copy ACOS.OBJ, ENCODE and ACOS.SYSTEM from the Acos folder to your master GBBS.SYSTEM folder. Then copy CONFIG.SYSTEM from the Config folder to your master GBBS.CONFIG folder.

Your master GBBS.CONFIG folder should contain these files:

	PRODOS
	CONFIG.SYSTEM
	BC.S
	LOGON.SEG.S
	MAIN.SEG.S
	MSG.CONVERT.S
	MSG.SEG.S
	NEW.MSG.FIX.S
	SYSTEM.SEG.S
	USER.CONVERT.S


Your master GBBS.SYSTEM folder should contain these files:

	ACOS.OBJ
	ACOS.SYSTEM
	ENCODE
	B1
	BBS
	DATA
	DATA1
	DATA2
	G1
	G1.1
	G1.2
	HLP.EDIT
	HLP.MAIN
	HLP.MSG
	HLP.USER
	MAIL
	MNU.NEW
	MNU.VAL.40
	NMU.VAL.80
	SYS.INFO
	SYS.NEW.INFO
	SYS.NEWS
	SYS.QUESTIONS
	USER
	V1.1
	V1.2
	V1.3
	V1.4
	X.DN
	X.UP
	XDOS



*** INSTALLED FOLDERS ***

Where 'v' is the base path, usually the volume name

NOTE: The ACOS source lists these as (not sure why the difference):

$900 - CONSOLE DRIVER

*** OLD FILES ***

Only the files that are used are in the main folders above. In each may or may not be an "old" folder that contains files that did not seem to be used, or were old or otherwise modified versions of files.

NOTE: As the original programmer was not available to give guidance on this project, it was not always clear which file to use. There were no build instructions or other documentation and the files used were determined by code review and trial/error. In other words, it is possible that files in Old folders contain later code, which may or may not build, run, etc.
