         ---------------------         [ Userlist Menu Bar ]         ---------------------    [ Match letters (<CR>=All,?) ]There are 4 options that may be used inthe  userlist command when you see  theUserlist Menu Bar:[1]  A blank <CR>.  This will list  all     the users of this system.[2]  If  you  type a [#] followed by  a     number,  the system will show  you     that user,  and all the users that     follow. [3]  A person's  full name.  The system     will match the person if he is  on     this system. [4]  A partial,  first or last name. If     you  forget a person's name,  need     to  know  an  exact  spelling,  or     don't know their user number  then     you  can  find it by  telling  the     system  as  much of the  first  or     last name as you know, and it will     print  the full name of users that     fit the pattern.
